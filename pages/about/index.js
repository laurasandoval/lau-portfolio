                        Born in Peru {Age} years ago. Moved to Chile a year after that. Then
                        back to Peru in 2014. And back to Chile again two years later. So

                        I strive to design wonderful and accessible digital products that go
                        unnoticed in day-to-day life, while staying true to their intended
                        meaning. Currently doing that at Cornershop, an Uber-owned grocery
                        delivery service that offers world-class digital products powered by
                        software and design.
