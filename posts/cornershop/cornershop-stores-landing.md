Website redesign for "Cornershop for Stores" landing page.

The entire website was redesigned and rewritten from the ground up, providing first-class support for assistive technologies —such as keyboard navigation and screen readers— in every step of the process.

Cornershop was an Uber-owned grocery delivery service that offered world-class digital products powered by software and design. It debuted in 2015, got acquired by Uber in 2021, and was later migrated to Uber Eats in 2023, bringing the magic of the Cornershop experience to millions of users worldwide.
