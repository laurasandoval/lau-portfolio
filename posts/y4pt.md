Branding and graphic design for Y4PT’s 2nd Chilean National Transport Hackathon.

The vector-based illustration developed for the event reassembled key landmarks of both Santiago and Concepción —the two chilean cities in which the event took place—, contained in a 2-shaped grid to symbolize the 2nd edition.
