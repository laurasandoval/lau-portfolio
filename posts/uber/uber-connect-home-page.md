Uber Connect —also known as \"Uber Flash\"— is Uber’s customer-facing “Delivery as a Service” product. It allows people to send items the same day, whether it’s a care item for a loved one, a gift for a friend’s birthday, an item sold online, or a business document.

In 2023, Uber Connect introduced post office dropoffs, allowing people to easily return their online purchases or deliver any type of prepaid package via Fedex, UPS or USPS without leaving the Uber app.

To make room for this new feature, we decided to redesign the entire Connect Home Page, providing a clear mental model for customers using Connect, and improving the overall understanding on Connect's products and services.
