In 5 months, designed, developed, and shipped a grocery delivery service for Uber Eats from scratch.

By leveraging existing products and expertise from Cornershop, Uber Grocery has helped Uber Eats add more than 24,000 grocery stores around the world into its catalog —including Albertsons, Carrefour, Costco and Woolworths—, and has allowed Uber Eats customers to order at least 100,000 bunches of bananas each month.

Cornershop was an Uber-owned grocery delivery service that offered world-class digital products powered by software and design. It debuted in 2015, got acquired by Uber in 2021, and was later migrated to Uber Eats in 2023, bringing the magic of the Cornershop experience to millions of users worldwide.
