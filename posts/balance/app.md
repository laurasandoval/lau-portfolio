With its unique functionalities, native iOS look & feel, and deep attention to accessibility and details, Balance has consistently remained within the most downloaded navigation apps in Chile ever since its launch in 2019 — reaching up to the #1 most downloaded Chilean navigation app in 2021 and 2023, right above Google Maps, Moovit, and Waze — and it’s by far the most positively reviewed one among its local alternatives.
