Towards the end of 2020, Cornershop by Uber was in the midst of its most intense growth period, boosted by quarantines and the increase reliance on delivery services. Additionally, that same year we had just launched Uber Grocery delivery, meaning that any merchant that signed-up for Cornershop was automatically available inside the Uber and Uber Eats apps too.

We thought this was an inmense value proposition for merchants, yet our then landing page was not a reflection of it.

The entire website was redesigned and rewritten from the ground up, providing first-class support for assistive technologies —such as keyboard navigation and screen readers— in every step of the process.

Cornershop was an Uber-owned grocery delivery service that offered world-class digital products powered by software and design. It debuted in 2015, got acquired by Uber in 2021, and was later migrated to Uber Eats in 2023, bringing the magic of the Cornershop experience to millions of users worldwide.
