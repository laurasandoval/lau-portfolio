Website redesign for Cornershop's referral landing page.

All visual elements of the website were redesigned and rewritten from scratch using modern and native web standards to allow for better accessibility, lightning-fast load times, and enormous flexibility.

Cornershop was an Uber-owned grocery delivery service that offered world-class digital products powered by software and design. It debuted in 2015, got acquired by Uber in 2021, and was later migrated to Uber Eats in 2023, bringing the magic of the Cornershop experience to millions of users worldwide.
