Originally aimed at making Cornershop's web application suitable for smaller screen sizes, multiple discussions between the Product Design and Engineering teams snowballed the project into a complete redesign and development of the website.

While preserving its underlying JavaScript foundations, the entire markup and CSS of the web app were reimagined and rebuilt from the ground up, taking advantage of modern CSS properties to achieve native-feeling interactions, visually polished elements, and a brand new, mobile-first component library—all while taking the opportunity to significantly improve accessibility for both screen readers and keyboard users throughout every point of the experience.

Most JavaScript-powered UI libraries were deprecated from the codebase afterward, helping consolidate a mature, proprietary, and flexible design and development environment.

Cornershop was an Uber-owned grocery delivery service that offered world-class digital products powered by software and design. It debuted in 2015, was acquired by Uber in 2021, and later migrated to Uber Eats in 2023, bringing the magic of the Cornershop experience to millions of users worldwide.
