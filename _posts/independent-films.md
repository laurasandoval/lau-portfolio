Prior to my work in [Product Design](/work/discipline/product-design) and [Engineering](/work/discipline/engineering), I spent 4 years as an independent online filmmaker (aka “a YouTuber”)—growing an audience of over 10K subscribers and achieving more than 900K cumulative views between 2013 and 2016.

During this time, I also produced internal short films for organizations such as the [University of Piura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Piura) and [DRRP Spaces](https://drrpspaces.com), among others.

In 2016, after studying filmmaking professionally for one semester, I decided to shift my focus to design.
