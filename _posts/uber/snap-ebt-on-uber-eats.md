SNAP EBT (also known as "food stamps") is a government assistance program that provides lower-income individuals and families with an alternative means of purchasing food.

In late 2023, Uber decided to add SNAP EBT support to Uber Eats, allowing thousands of new customers to join the platform and enabling new possibilities for millions of existing ones.

SNAP EBT was officially launched in the second half of 2024, in partnership with Albertsons across all U.S. cities where Albertsons is available.
