In 5 months, we designed, developed, and shipped a grocery delivery service for Uber Eats from scratch.

![The product was based on Cornershop's Web App, and lived inside the Uber and Uber Eats apps.](/assets/design-work/uber/uber-grocery-with-cornershop/uber-grocery-home.png)

![The service was available in the US, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Mexico, and Costa Rica.](/assets/design-work/uber/uber-grocery-with-cornershop/uber-grocery-department.png)

![After Cornershop was deprecated in 2023, Uber Grocery became part of Uber's native products stack.](/assets/design-work/uber/uber-grocery-with-cornershop/uber-grocery-product.png)

By leveraging existing products and expertise from Cornershop, Uber Grocery helped Uber Eats add more than 24,000 grocery stores around the world to its catalog—including Albertsons, Carrefour, Costco, and Woolworths—and allowed Uber Eats customers to order at least 100,000 bunches of bananas each month.

Cornershop was an Uber-owned grocery delivery service that offered world-class digital products powered by software and design. It debuted in 2015, was acquired by Uber in 2021, and later migrated to Uber Eats in 2023, bringing the magic of the Cornershop experience to millions of users worldwide.
