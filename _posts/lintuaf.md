Fintual is a Chilean fintech startup offering a low-cost, user-friendly platform for investing in diversified portfolios.

In 2021, I found some private Fintual APIs, which I then used to create my own private client for iOS—because why not!

![Unlike with the official Fintual app, Lintuaf allows you to see a combined summary of your investments at a glance.](/assets/design-work/lintuaf/lintuaf-goals-view.png)

This project was not commissioned, reviewed, or approved by, and is not associated with Fintual in any way.
