Lintuaf is a silly little side-project I made for myself because I didn't like the official Fintual client for iOS and I found some private Fintual APIs I could use to build my own.

In real life, Fintual is a Chilean asset management startup that makes investments easy, and I've been using it for a couple of years now.

This project was not commissioned, reviewed, or approved by, and it's not associated with Fintual in any way.
