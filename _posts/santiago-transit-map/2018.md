Transit map for Santiago's transit system.

![](/assets/design-work/santiago-transit-map/2018/santiago-transit-map-s3.png)

The map was specially designed with color-blind individuals and newcomers to Santiago's transit system in mind, incorporating redundant and accessible iconography— that doesn't rely on color alone—while still maintaining a flexible and approachable design language.

One hundred physical copies of the map were printed and distributed in mid-2018. This project was not commissioned by, and is not directly related to, any of Santiago's official transit authorities.
