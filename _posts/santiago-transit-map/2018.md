Transit map for Santiago's Transit system.

The map was specially designed with color-blinded individuals and newcomers to Santiago's transit system in mind, incorporing redundant and accessible iconography —that doesn't really on color alone—, while still maintaning a flexible and approachable design language.

100 physical copies of the map were printed and distributed in mid-2018.
This project was not commissioned by, and it's not directly related to any of Santiago's official transit authorities.
