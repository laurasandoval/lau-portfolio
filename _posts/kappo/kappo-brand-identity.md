Led, designed, and implemented a complete brand identity redesign for Kappo Bike, a now-defunct app for logging your bicycle trips around the city.

Based in Santiago de Chile, Kappo Bike aimed to become a global facilitator of tools for smart city development around sustainable mobility, with tools such as "PedalHeat", Kappo's government-oriented solution for mapping out bike lane usage, "Cool Place to Bike", Kappo's B2B solution for encouraging bicycle usage within companies, and many more.

The development of this project resulted in a comprehensive Brand Book and internal websites and documents with guidance around the usage of the new Kappo brand.
