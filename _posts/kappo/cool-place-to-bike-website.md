Website redesign and development for Kappo's Cool Place to Bike program.

Based in Santiago de Chile, Kappo Bike aimed to become a global facilitator of tools for smart city development around sustainable mobility, with tools such as "PedalHeat," Kappo's government-oriented solution for mapping out bike lane usage, "Cool Place to Bike," Kappo's B2B solution for encouraging bicycle usage within companies, and many more.
